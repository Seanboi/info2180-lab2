        Bleach, a piece of media that has been ongoing since 2004 and has been a part ofthe hearts of many fans
        of anime or japanese media. This is a cartoon that is best known for its Main character Ichigo Kurosaki, 
        as he one day is granted a power by a mysterious woman and becomes a shinigami. A shinigami is roughly translated 
        to a God of Death, however he is not evil and he guides lost souls to the after life. Many evil monsters and people 
        wish to feed on these souls before they can reach there and it is his duty to protect them.

        Bleach is widely considered one of the best anime out there compared to the likes of naruto, one piece and Dragon Ball Z,
        it is a heavily favourited anime by many, including me of course. The amazing fights and emotional depth of the story 
        gets you intertwined in the life of this random character that is on our screens.

        Dogs, a man's best friend. Dog's are one of the greatest creatures to come to earth. There are such a variety of them 
        in the world that every man can have his own best friend. I have a German Shepherd called Bartholomew and he is such
        a genle giant, he truly is such a great dog. He is kind to smaller dogs and even cats the natural enemy of Dogs just 
        to prove how Dogs are one of the greatest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many Dogs despite how great they are treated very badly and need better care. Many owners do not value their dogs and it is really
        sad to see such nice creatures be treated with such cruelty. Despite being a mans best friends many of us don't seem to be a 
        dogs best friend.

    <h3> About Sean Spence</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Sean Spence, You may already know as this is my blog and you are on it. I am a college student studying for a Bachelors 
        in Computer Science and I really enjoy it. I am born in Jamaica and grew up in a Town called Portmore in St. Catherine. I am 20 years
        old and hopefully I'll see many more of those years. I attended Kingston College as my Highschool and Portmore Missionary Prep when I
        was younger.  In the future I hope to own a business/company centered around technology and become really big in the tech world.
        Seems like a pipe dream but my goal is set and I am working hard to reach it.
